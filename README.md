Merge 🚀

What is Merge?

Merge is an “agentic AI in natural language for your Jira workflow”. 
In short: it enables you to interact with your Jira issues using natural language, streamlining issue tracking and workflow.

Why we built it

Problem: Developers spend a lot of time managing issues in Jira and translating them into actionable work.

Solution: Merge leverages AI to bridge the gap — letting you describe a task in normal language and automatically triggering the right change in your workflow.

Goal: Provide a smarter, more intuitive interface for issue management and help teams move from planning to execution faster.
